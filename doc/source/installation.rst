Download
========


The :mod:`scikits.hydroclimpy` module itself is currently available through subversion only.
You can download the latest version of the source files by checking out the repository with the command::

   svn co http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scikits/trunk/hydroclimpy hydroclimpy

This command will create a :file:`hydroclimpy` folder in the current directory.
On Windows, you can also use a SVN client such as `Tortoise SVN <http://tortoisesvn.net/>`_.



Installation
============

To install the :mod:`scikits.hydroclimpy` package, run the command::

    python setup.py install

in the directory you checked out the source code to.

If you run Python 2.6, note that you should probably use the ``--user`` or
``--home`` flags to install the package locally, without interfering with
the system installation.


Configuration
=============

The package requires a configuration file (``'hydroclimpyrc'``) to be imported.
An example of configuration file is provided with the sources and is copied in the installation directory.
This file should be modified by the user according to his/her needs.

When the package is imported, the file is looked for successively 
in the following locations successively:

   * the current working directory
   * the directory reprensented by the environment variable ``HYDROCLIMPYRC``
   * the ``$HOME/.hydroclimpy`` directory
   * the ``$PYTHONPATH/hydroclimpy`` directory
