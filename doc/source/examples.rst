The following pages describe some examples of usage of the :mod:`scikits.hydroclimpy`
module.

By convention, we will assume that the following modules are imported.
It is customary to import :mod:`numpy` as ``np``,
and the masked array module :mod:`numpy.ma` as ``ma``.
We will also import the :mod:`scikits.hydroclimpy` module as ``hydro``.

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> import numpy.ma as ma
   >>> import scikits.hydroclimpy as hydro


.. note::

   All the objects (modules, classes, functions...) defined by 
   the :mod:`scikits.timeseries` module are directly available through 
   :mod:`scikits.hydroclimpy`.
